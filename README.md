DNest4
======

DNest4 is a C++11 implementation of Diffusive Nested Sampling, a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian Inference and Statistical Mechanics.

Before you use DNest4, you might want to read the paper describing the
Diffusive Nested Sampling algorithm. If you find this software useful in your

Improvements over DNest3:
=========================

*	There are far fewer dependencies --- all you need is a C++ compiler that
	supports the C++11 standard, along with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib
	for the post-processing scripts. Because of this, it should be much easier
	to compile (at least on a Unix-like operating system such as Ubuntu or
	Mac OS X).

*	The licence is now the permissive MIT licence.

*	RJObject (which allows relatively straightforward implementation of
	hierarchical and trans-dimensional mixture models)
	is now included in the same repository.

Some functions have slightly different names and specifications compared to
DNest3. These changes are purely cosmetic.
The manual (in the doc directory) can be compiled with pdflatex.
